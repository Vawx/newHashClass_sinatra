# NewHashClass

Explore the Hash class in IRB to understand how Ruby hashes work and how methods such as .new(), .store() and .fetch() function (you can also reference your previous work with hashes here. Then, recreate the Hash class as a custom class. With your new hash class, build the functionality found in the methods, Hash#store and Hash#fetch.

Remember: You should not be using the Ruby Class, Hash, in this exercise. You are building it yourself!
